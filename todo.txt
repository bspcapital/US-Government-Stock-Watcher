What I've Done:
- created a general scraping tool that finds all stock/securities purchases made by active US Senators in the last 2 years
- a .csv output from the above that contains the above, minus senators who disclosed via PDF rather than the web tool

What is Coming:
- formatting the data
- finding a way to complete the scraping tool so it scans PDFs neatly and adds to the output above
- using existing/new scraping tool to gather same info from congressmen (PDFs only)
- figuring out how to automate for future disclosures...
- Full Stack Planning
- Full Stack implementation
- Monetization
- Deployment
- Marketting
- Adding to Resume
- Freelancing
- Rinse and Repeat
